# Core features
1. Shortening URLs
2. Redirecting short URLs
3. Analytics

# Performance needs
Shortening url feature should handle up to 60 requests per minute (RPM) during peak hours.
Redirection feature should handle up to 600 RPM during peak hours.

# Scalability
* Web server: horizontal, auto scaling based on the CPU load and RPM
* DB server: horizontal, auto scaling based on the CPU load
* Redis server: horizontal

# **Security Concerns**
Use rate limiter per API key. Malicious content is out of scope.

# System Design
- **Architecture**: monolith
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL
- **Shortening Algorithm**: Plan an algorithm that is efficient, generates unique identifiers, and can handle scaling.
- **API Design**: Define RESTful APIs for creating, retrieving, and managing short URLs.

### 3. Scalability Planning
- **Load Balancing**: Plan for distributing traffic to prevent any single point of failure.
- **Caching**: Identify opportunities for caching (e.g., frequently accessed URLs).
- **Database Scalability**: Consider replication, partitioning, and sharding strategies.

### 4. Reliability and Redundancy
- **High Availability**: Ensure system components have redundancy to handle failures.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Plan for data backup and recovery mechanisms.

### 5. Security Measures
- **Input Validation**: Ensure robust input validation to prevent injections and other attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Plan for secure handling and storage of data.

### 6. Analytics and Monitoring
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up logging for errors, traffic, and performance metrics.
- **Analytics**: Decide on analytics data to be collected and how it will be processed.

### 7. Compliance and Privacy
- **User Data Handling**: Ensure compliance with privacy laws for user data handling and storage.
- **Terms of Service**: Prepare clear terms of service, including acceptable use policy.

### 8. Prototyping
- **Prototype**: Build a minimal viable product (MVP) to validate the core functionality and architecture.
- **Feedback Loop**: Plan for gathering feedback and iterate based on this feedback.

### 9. Deployment Strategy
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment.
- **Environment Planning**: Plan development, testing, staging, and production environments.

### 10. Future Proofing
- **Scalability Path**: Have a clear plan for scaling up as the user base grows.
- **Technology Watch**: Keep an eye on emerging technologies that could enhance the system.
